# Product Spec

## Product Summary

`codex-project-template` is a reusable starting point for building a development harness around Codex. Its job is to help a repository store context, define sprint-sized work, verify outcomes, and preserve handoff information so coding can continue across sessions or machines.

## Users

- Individual developers using Codex in day-to-day project work
- Teams that want a shared harness structure before building plugins or background automation

## Core User Journeys

1. Start a new project with a stable Codex operating structure.
2. Turn a vague feature request into a sprint contract and implement it incrementally.
3. Review a completed sprint with QA notes and preserve the next step for a later session.

## Product Priorities

1. Keep the harness small, readable, and easy to adopt.
2. Make long-running coding tasks resumable through files.
3. Support progressive growth toward stronger QA, skills, and automation.
4. Provide concise, source-backed engineering standards for common implementation stacks without forcing a single stack.
5. Reduce token waste on commodity modules by preferring mature lightweight integrations for personal and small projects.
6. Keep generated UI workflows aligned with familiar, humane interaction patterns instead of letting AI invent awkward flows.
7. Keep backend workflow design lightweight by default while preserving resumable state in the database.
8. Preserve global planning decisions in a repository implementation plan so execution does not drift across Codex modes or sessions.

## Technical Shape

- Frontend: not required by the template
- Backend: not required by the template
- Storage: markdown files and repository history
- Integrations: Codex, optional local skills, optional automation, optional project-specific tooling
- Planning: `docs/implementation-plan.md` for locked global delivery sequence and task IDs
- Standards: markdown guidance under `docs/standards/` for Python, Java, database design, backend workflows, frontend work, UI interaction, and reusable commodity modules

## Constraints

- The template should stay useful without requiring heavy infrastructure.
- New structure should be added only after a workflow proves repetitive or fragile.
- Technology standards should stay lightweight and should not introduce toolchain requirements before a real project selects that stack.
- Database design guidance should scale by project size and avoid premature architecture patterns.
- Reusable module guidance should favor email-first authentication and simple hosted payment flows for personal or small products.
- UI interaction guidance should define product behavior without forcing a visual brand or component library.
- Backend workflow guidance should default to in-process memory queues plus database state for small tasks, and require explanation before medium or heavy workflow infrastructure is introduced.
- Sprint contracts should derive from the implementation plan when it exists, instead of re-planning the project from scratch.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing project-specific engineering judgment
- Forcing a single stack, framework, or deployment model

## Acceptance Direction

The primary acceptance flow is: define a sprint, implement within that sprint, run verification, record QA, and leave clear progress for the next Codex run.

## Open Questions

- Which additional local skills are worth standardizing after the first few real projects?
- When should the template evolve into a plugin or automation bundle?
